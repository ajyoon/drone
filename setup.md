Setup instructions for drone.py

Download and unpack the project files.
1) Through a browser (recommended): https://github.com/ajyoon/drone/archive/master.zip
2) Extract the files and place anywhere in your computer.

Or through git in the command line: 
```bash
cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/program
git clone https://github.com/ajyoon/drone.git
```

Install the latest version of Python 3.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Although this program has been tested and shown to work in Python version 3.4.3 and 2.7.6, 3 is recommended as the program was built primarily on it.

Install project requirements using pip from your system's command line
```bash
cd /path/to/drone/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This may take some time.

To launch the program, simply run drone.py with python:
```bash
cd /path/to/drone/folder
python drone.py
```
