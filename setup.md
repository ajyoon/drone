Download and unpack the project files.
Through a browser: https://github.com/ajyoon/drone/archive/master.zip
Through git in the command line: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajyoon/drone.git
```

Install Python 3 (At least v. 3.3)

Install project requirements using pip from your system's command line
```bash
cd /path/to/drone/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This may take some time.

To launch the program, simply run drone.py with python:

```
