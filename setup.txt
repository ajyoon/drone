Setup instructions for drone.py
===============================

1) Download and unpack the project files.

Through an internet browser (recommended):
Download and extract project folder.
https://github.com/ajyoon/drone/archive/master.zip

Or through git in the command line: 
---------------------------------------------
cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/program
git clone https://github.com/ajyoon/drone.git
---------------------------------------------

2) Install the latest version of Python 3.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Although this program has been tested and shown to work in
Python version 3.4.3 and 2.7.6, 3 is recommended as the
program was built primarily on it.

3) Install project requirements using pip from your computer's terminal:
-------------------------------
cd /path/to/drone/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
-------------------------------
This may take some time.

4) To launch the program, simply run drone.py with python in your terminal:
------------------------
cd /path/to/drone/folder
python drone.py
------------------------
Make sure that the input and output devices are connected
before launching the program.

The program uses input from your computer's primary audio input channel.
This should lead to a simple microphone which captures the sound on stage.
The exact position and quality of the microphone is not crucial, as
it is only used to measure the amplitude of the on-stage sound.

Audio output should be in the form of a simple on-stage amplifier,
connected to the computer's primary audio output channel. The computer's
master volume level should be configured such that the drone typically matches
the level of the violins and violas -  a very quiet pianissimo.

See operation_instructions.txt for a guide on using the program itself.
